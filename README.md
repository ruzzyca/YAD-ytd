# YAD YouTube Download is a simple yad GUI for youtube-dl (included)

	(http://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl)

for latest version run:

		curl -L https://yt-dl.org/downloads/latest/youtube-dl # and replace included ytd.
	or
		run "ytd -U" after install

( I chose to rename it to avoid conflicts with original older versions in the repositories of the old distributions that have different options and will not work )

# youtube-dl supported sites

	http://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/supportedsites.html

#	Dependencies:

		ffmpeg or avconv, yad


# Usage:

	It can be used from the command line, but can also be integrated in Firefox thanks to an addon:

		https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/open-with/

		(https://github.com/darktrojan/openwith)

	then run firefox, open the "open with" options and add *.desktop file from:

		/opt/ytd/ff_open_with_addon/

	see open_with_ff_settings.png image example.
